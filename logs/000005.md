# Dicision: manage one or several slip-boxes? | 13.7. 2021

Following the [goal of this project][000001], managing my digital notes means,
that I have a freedom to have as many slip-boxes as I can imagine. The question
is if it is a good idea?

## Pros of having several slip-boxes

Some ideas are only valid in one context. Like implementation dicisions for a
particular project. If these would be inside one all-including slip-box, the
slip-box would grow in size without actually containing valuable information.
The project-specific ideas would only get noticed, if somebody worked on the
project.

## Pros of having only one slip-box

The more notes there is in a slip-box, the better. There are more possible
connections, therefore more opportunities for new ideas to emerge.

## Conclusion

Right now it seems it is best to have more slip-boxes. Having only one seems to
be

1. unreasonably limited, because adding more slipboxes does not make the
   (general) problem harder, it just makes the problem appear more than once
2. having one slipbox means having one format and one standard for a note, which
   I am not comfortable with. I like not having to invest as much time into
   these notes as to my main notes
3. there is a problem of different lifespan. Even though this project is ongoing
   it may bore me in the future, or I will just let it go. Whereas my main notes
   will always add up.

The worst thing which can happen is that I will often like to link these notes
to my notes in main slipbox. In that case I could add new feature to merge two
slipboxes (which should be added that in either case if we are managing more
than one slipbox).
