# Previewing connections within a slipbox

The goal is to display all notes and how they are connected within the text-base
UI that neovim (and telescope) offers. The usefulness of this feature would be
twofold:

1. Display all the contents of a slipbox as an overview. This would enable users
   to explore the written ideas and generate new ones.

2. Serve as a basis when developing certain idea.

Implementing some kind of preview functionality to fulfill the first goal is
hard. The ideal solution is graphical and involves 2 dimensions. Shrinking it to
one does seem to reduce the informative value, which in turn renders the feature
worthless.

To fulfill the second goal I got a possible solution: write an idea and a
algorithm chooses ideas closes to it.
