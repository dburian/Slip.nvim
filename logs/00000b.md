# Note's metadata format | 26.7. 2021

Inevitably we will encounter situations where we would like to know something
about a [permanent note][000003]. We'll call these information metadata. To
successfully parse these data they must be expressed the same way throughout a
slip box (why not allow different slip boxes to have different format?).

The goals are (sorted by priority):
- let the user define how the metadata are expressed per slip box
- enable fast parsing of the metadata
- keep the note in human-readable format

TODO: how will the user decide metadata's format?
*For now let us consider fixed metadata's format.*

To ensure fast parsing of the metadata, we'll keep their definition on the top
of the file. It will not be a huge speed up, but it is the best we can do. Let
us say that once the note's name is loaded, we will assume all the metadata were
parsed.

Note's metadata (continually added):

- name - names the idea expressed in note
- links_to - lists all notes this note links to

[000003]: ./000003.md
