# Note's links_to format

Elaborating on [Note's metadata format][00000b] this note talks about the format
of note's links.

I decided to use

- named links, because it keeps the note readable
- predefined links, because it keeps the text shorter and therefore, again, more
  readble.

Links' definitions can be inserted before the first link definition (assumed to
be before the definition of link's name). If there is no link definition before
the link's name, links shall be inserted at the first line of the note.
