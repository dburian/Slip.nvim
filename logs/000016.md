# Listing 'close' notes

Elaborating on [Previewing connections within a slipbox][000015]. First question
is what makes a note 'close' to another note. The obvious answer is a
link or -with graph terminology- the number of paths and their length between
the two notes.

We'll begin with simple rating algorithm and adjust it later.

The longer the path between two notes the more distant they are (lineary). The
more paths there is between the two notes, the more close they are.
