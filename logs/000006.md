# Problem: rewriting referenced note | 12.7. 2021

When referencing a note (part of the [Workflow: writing new permanent
notes][000004] we are referencing its contents not itsefl. This means when we
are rewriting a note or otherwise changing its contents, the contents of other
notes referencing changed note might not make sense.

The only solution would be to fully separate the note itself (or rather it's
identity) from its contents. This is however impossible as with each reference
we are (as said earlier) refering to it's contents. The maximum we can do is to
give each note a filename, not dependant on its contents, so at least all links
would remain functional.

When rewriting the notes we would need to go through all reverse references to
that note to ensure we did not change the meaning of any of the references.
