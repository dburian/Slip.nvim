[00000f]: 00000f.md

# Index format

For now let us keep [Index][00000f]'s format simple. A header with the name of
the given slip and then a numbered list with links to the leaf nodes should
suffice.

Example:
```markdown
# <slip's name>'s index

1. [first note][000001]
1. [second note][000002]
1. [third note][000003]
1. [fourth note][000004]

```
