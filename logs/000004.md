# Workflow: Writing new permanent notes | 13.7. 2021

To manage my digital slip-box ([Goals of this project][000001]) I will need to
write new permanent notes. According to the Zettelkasten method writing new
permanent notes should include these steps:

1. Take down fleeting notes
2. At the end of the day, go through fleeting notes and create new permanent
   notes out of them.
    1. Create new permanent note
    2. Insert links to previously written notes
    3. Check previously written notes for new ideas and connections
    4. Save the new note
    5. Update index in order to be able to reach to the new note (basically when
        the new note is a leaf)
