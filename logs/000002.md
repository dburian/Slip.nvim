# Mindset | 13.7. 2021

As I mentioned in [project goals][000001], I do not really know where I am
going with this. Without a clear goal there is a danger of this project becoming
a big mess.

To limit the amount of code that will be rewritten I should:

- make minimal assumptions about the use-cases
- implement only the bare minimum to make a certain feature work.

[000001]: ./000001.md
