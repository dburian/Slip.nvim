# Creating a permanent note

Step from a [How a permanent note is written][000004]. Creating new
permanent note can be further divided into the following sub-steps:

1. Obtaining a path of directory where the note will be placed

Just a simple path would suffice, yet this would be highly unfriendly to users.
The solution would be to initialize the plugin with configuration and then
simply identify the slip box. As argued in [Should we manage one or several slip
boxes?][000005] there should an option to have more than just one slip box.
Each with a string name as an id.

2. Obtaining the note's filename

As was mentioned in [Rewriting referenced note][000006] note's identity
(filename) should not be dependent on its contents. I decided to use hexadecimal
numbering of fixed digits. Having fixed digits ensures alphabetical ordering
will be the same as numerical one. When all the names will be depleted (for 6
digits its 16^6 = 16 mil) we can just start using more digits.

3. Creating the file

It should not exist (viz naming system), there is really not problem here.

4. Editing the file

Should it open as split or full? It should be decided on the fly, as we cannot
predict the user scenario (same as with choosing the slip box).
