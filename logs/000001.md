# Goal of this project | 13.7.2021

This project aims to develop a neovim plugin that will help ME to organise and
work with my digital slip-box. My workflow is influenced by

- the Zettelkasten method
- my preference.

At the same time I would like to explore embedded lua and telescope. Therefore
this project will rely on those two things, namely:

1. neovim 0.5
2. telescope (+plenary)

## About the log

As I am not yet familiar with my workflow in Zettelkasten, I started this
slip-box to help me think about the direction this plugin should be headed.
