# Viewing written notes

As the number of notes increases it is more evident that we need some ways to
know our way around the notes (particulary mentioned in [Creating a new permanent

different methods of display are necessary.

## Index

Index is used to get a picture of a slip box as a whole. It enumerates the leave
nodes and thus reveals the 'unfinished thoughts'.
