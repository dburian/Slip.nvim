# Inserting links

In my workflow [How a permanent note is written][000004] I would like to
insert links to already written notes. I would like to automate this process as
much as possible, as it is expect to be frequent. Inserting a link has several
substeps:

1. Choosing a place where to insert the link
1. Choosing a note to which to link
1. Inserting the link

## Choosing a place where to insert the link

This should probably be at the cursor's position.

## Choosing a note to which to link

This should be done on the go with an appropriate selection mechanism like
Telescope. Listing all the available notes, with their

- names
- contents and
- filenames

would be the preferable option as it supplies the user with the maximal
amount of information.

## Inserting the link

FIXME: not up to date anymore
Because links will not be inserted in-text we need to check first if the target
was already used or not (in order to avoid listing a link target twice).

Naming the link should be done in document, so that the user can read again the
previously written text when thinking about the link's label. To avoid any
complex behaviour I decided to simply drop the user into insert mode inside
brackets after all the necessary insertions(link's target record and link's
target name) were made.
