# Planned feature list

After several features ([Creating a permanent note][000003], [Inserting
links][000007], [Updating index][000012]) I've written enough code to understand
what I want to create. Now let's concretize the future features:

- creating a new note

    Automatically open a new named buffer and offer the user to choose where on
    the go.

- listing notes

    Display a picker that enumerates all notes in current slip.

- inserting link to a note

    Preview all written notes, upon selection insert link at cursor position
    while keeping the note well-formatted.

- updating index

    Take the current note and update the list of leaves in the current slip's
    index.

- autocommand events

    Define autocommand events like NewNote, WriteNotePre, WriteNotePost that can
    be bound to different actions.

- introduce literature notes

    Basically whenever there was a note, there could be now a literature note.
    This means links, listing notes, creating notes, etc.

- previewing slip's branches

    Display a picker that enables the user to track notes' interconnections and
    follow links right inside the picker.
