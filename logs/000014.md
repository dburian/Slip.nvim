# Module list

The features listed in [Planned feature list][000013] can be split into multiple categories:

- magic with telescope
    - listing notes
    - previewing slip's branches
    - inserting links - listing and selection

- actions
    - creating a note
    - updating index
    - inserting links - actually change the buffer

- helpers
    - autocommand events
    - functionality supporting actions

This gives us clear distinction between the features and also a hint as to how
the API should be structured.

*Telescope magic* can be split up to modules similarly how telescope does it
internally.

1. pickers - predefined pickers to manipulate with notes or slips
2. finders - predefined functions to search notes or slips
3. previewers - predefined previewer to display notes


*Actions* should have unified API since they are going to be called by the user.
Of course the user can dive deeper (under their responsibility) calling
individual modules. The actions should have unified and easy-to-use API. Hence
these functions should get by without any arguments. The actions now consists of
only single module, since there are only a few actions.

1. actions - wrapper functions with user-friendly API which rely on other
   modules

*Helpers* provide functionality which the `actions` module wraps.

1. notes - helper functions that operate with notes
2. slips - helper functions that operate with slips
3. files - helper functions that operate with files and the file system
4. config - helper functions that change slip's configuration
