# More code less logs

Recently, with the features [inserting links to notes][000007] and [viewing
notes][000008] I have been writting more logs than code. This is absolutely not
the goal. The mistake is thinking about and writting about obvious stuff because
I lack the experience of both using my plugin and using Zettlekasten. I should
concentrate on:

- keeping these short,
- writting about more complicated things (or things I really want to capture).
