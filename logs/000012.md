# Updating index

Updating [Index][00000f] means running a function from a changed note. For
simplicity let us say the current note references only one note. The function
has to execute following steps:

1. Finding index (creating one if no exist - as said in [Index configuration][000011])
2. Finding the referenced note in the index
    1. The note was found

      Replace the link with a link to the current note
    2. The note was not found

      Add a new link to the current note
3. Save the index

## More references

When the updated/changed note references more notes, which links in the index
should we update?

1. All

2. Pick one

    Which one? We cannot say. Therefore I would go for the first option.


## When to update
