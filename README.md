# Features overview

Slip helps you manage two sets of markdown documents - bibliographical notes
and permanent notes. Slip's features:

- creating new permanent or bibliographical note
- inserting a link to another note
- keeping a list of yet unreferenced permanent notes in index file
- reviewing linked notes

# Installation

Slip heavily relies on [Telescope.nvim][telescope], which is probably the best
and most customizable fuzzy finder. Therefore it is a necessary dependency,
which you will need to install first.

Using Plug:

```vimscript
  Plug 'dburian/Slip.nvim'
```

# Configuration

TBD

# About Zettelkasten

There are now way too many articles about Zettelkasten, so you are probably
better off reading one of those. However if you want to truly adapt this
note-taking system I suggest you read *How to take smart notes* by SÃ¶nke
Ahrens(2017).
